## SampleMVVMRepo

Since Visual Studio atm doesn't have a scaffolder or something for vanilla MVVM projects, I will use this repository.  

The sole purpose of it is making it faster for me to start an MVVM project.


Steps to changing the name are following:
1) Project -> Properties: Change names there
2) Project -> Properties -> Assembly information...: Also change here
3) Solution Explorer -> Select project -> F2
4) Close IDE
5) Open project folder where .sln file is, rename .sln, rename folder there
6) Open .sln, edit path to the only csproj
7) Open solution
8) Ctrl+R on namespace name
9) Ctrl+Shift+F old name just to be sure it's erased from human history
10) Done. That was easy, right?
